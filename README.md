Because I bought mac m1, I had no choice but to get a gap which is a situation I couldn't commit

> Why d.ts not .ts?
<--reason-->
I don't want to corrupt the environment after compilation
(because typescript is transformed to javascript, in this proccess, ts version typescript makes unwanted javascript file for type definition)
(it is useless I think when runtime so I use d.ts to ignore the result of compilation of this type of file)
